// An abstract factory is used when: For a same factory methods you have multiple implementation (can return different object of the same type).
// So you create this abstract factory class that contains the factory methods.
// The concrete factory classes will implement the abstract factory class and will contain the implementation of the factory methods.
// You will also create an abstract class that will be the base class for the objects that will be created by the factory methods.
